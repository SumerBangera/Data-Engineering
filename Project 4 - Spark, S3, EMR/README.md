## Introduction

A startup called Sparkify (think Spotify) wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in **understanding what songs users are listening to**. Currently, they have grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## Data Preview:
### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```
### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what a single log file looks like.
```
{"artist":null,"auth":"Logged In", "firstName":"Jordan", "gender":"F", "itemInSession":0, "lastName":"Hicks", "length":null, "level":"free", "location":"Salinas, CA", "method":"GET", "page":"Home", "registration":1540008898796.0, "sessionId":240, "song":null, "status":200,"ts":1541480984796, "userId":"37", "userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.78.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version\/7.0.6 Safari\/537.78.2\""}
```

## Task
Acting as Sparkify's Data Engineer, build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables to facilitate efficient data querying by the Analytics team. 
Detailed tasks include:
- Create Hadoop Clusters (EMR), Config files and security groups.
- Build ETL pipeline using Python, Spark and Amazon EMR
- Extract data from S3 buckets, transform (process) it and load processed data (parquet files) into another S3 bucket 
- Build a data lake to scale up analysis


## Schema for Song Play Analysis
The schema used for this exercise is the Star Schema with one main fact table and 4 dimentional tables

### Fact Table
**songplay** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
    - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension Tables
1. **users** - users in the app
    - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
2. **songs** - songs in music database
    - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
3. **artists** - artists in music database
    - artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
4. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Files
Details of the files used for the project:
1. **unzipData.py** run this to unzip .zip data in the local directory before using data from S3
2. **test.ipynb** use this file to test the ETL codes using local files or sample data from S3
3. **etl.py** reads and processes all files from log-data and song-data in the udacity-dend S3 bucket, processes them using Spark and loads them into S3 buckets as parquet files based on the above star schema.
4. **dl.cfg** - config file containing all important details about AWS configuration required for the project. DO NOT share the AWS KEY and SECRET. 

**Note:** Create an S3 Bucket (here, sparkify-bucket2) to store the output data before running the above files on cloud.
